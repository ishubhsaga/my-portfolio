NAVIGATION MENU - REFERENCE FILE
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  This file documents the navigation structure and how it works.
  In the main index.html, navigation is part of the <nav id="nav"> section.

WHAT THE NAV DOES:
  - Provides a menu for visitors to navigate to different sections
  - Uses anchor links to jump to section IDs instantly
  - Helps visitors find content quickly without scrolling
  - Creates a consistent navigation experience
  - Improves user experience and accessibility

HOW ANCHOR LINKS WORK:
  Step 1: Navigation link has: <a href="#about">About</a>
  Step 2: Matching section has: <section id="about">
  Step 3: When you click the "About" link, page jumps to that section
  Step 4: No page reload needed - instant navigation happens
  Step 5: Browser shows section ID in the URL (#about)

EXAMPLE OF ANCHOR LINK NAVIGATION:
  Link: <a href="#skills">Skills</a>
  Target: <section id="skills">
  Result: Clicking link jumps to skills section instantly

CURRENT NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:
  - About (tells about your learning journey)
  - Skills (lists your technical abilities)
  - Projects (showcases your portfolio projects)
  - Contact (how people can reach you)

WHERE TO ADD NEW SECTIONS:
  If you add a new section to your portfolio:
  
  Step 1: Give the section a unique ID
    <section id="new-section">
  
  Step 2: Add a matching nav link
    <li><a href="#new-section">New Section</a></li>
  
  Step 3: Keep the link text simple (1-3 words)
    ✓ Good: "Experience", "Certificates", "Blog"
    ✗ Bad: "My Previous Professional Experiences", "Certifications I Have"

  Step 4: Place nav link in logical order
    - Usually: About → Skills → Projects → Contact
    - Custom order: Whatever makes sense for your content

ANCHOR LINK IDS MUST:
  - Start with a letter (not a number)
  - Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
  - Not have spaces (use hyphens instead)
  
  ✓ Valid IDs: about, skills, my-projects, contact-me
  ✗ Invalid IDs: About, my projects, 1contact, _skills

TODO: When styling:
  - Make nav "sticky" (stays at top when scrolling)
  - Highlight current section as user scrolls
  - Add hover effects on nav links (underline, color change)
  - Add smooth scrolling behavior
  - Mobile: Create hamburger menu for small screens

TODO: When adding JavaScript:
  - Add smooth scroll animation when clicking links
  - Highlight active section based on scroll position
  - Add smooth scroll behavior: scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })
  - Create mobile responsive hamburger menu

COMMON NAVIGATION ADDITIONS:
  - Logo/branding on left side of nav
  - Home link (if multi-page site)
  - Social media links
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Mobile hamburger menu

BEST PRACTICES:
  - Keep navigation simple and uncluttered
  - Make navigation easy to find (top of page)
  - Use clear, descriptive link text
  - Ensure nav links are large enough to click
  - Test navigation on mobile devices
