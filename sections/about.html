EXAMPLE LEARNING STORY:
  "I'm a computer science student passionate about building web applications. 
   I started with vanilla HTML and CSS, then progressed to JavaScript fundamentals.

   Node.js and Express for backend APIs, and MongoDB for database design.

   My goal is to become a full-stack developer who can bring products to life from 
   concept to deployment."
