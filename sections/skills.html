================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  This file documents the skills section content and structure.
  In the main index.html, this content is in the <section id="skills"> element.

WHAT THIS SECTION DOES:
  - Lists your technical abilities and expertise
  - Shows what you can build and create
  - Demonstrates your MERN stack focus
  - Helps recruiters quickly assess your fit for positions
  - Shows your progress in learning
  - Increases visibility in searches

WHERE TO EDIT (in index.html):
  Find: <section id="skills">
  Edit skill lists to reflect YOUR actual experience:
  
  FRONTEND SKILLS:
  - HTML5 (semantic markup)
  - CSS3 (layouts, responsive design)
  - JavaScript (ES6+, DOM manipulation)
  - React (components, hooks, state management)
  
  BACKEND SKILLS:
  - Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment)
  - Express.js (web framework for APIs)
  - MongoDB (NoSQL database)
  
  TOOLS & SOFT SKILLS:
  - Git/GitHub (version control)
  - VS Code (code editor)
  - Terminal/CLI (command line)

HONESTY MATTERS - THIS IS CRITICAL:
  ✓ Only list skills you've ACTUALLY USED in real projects
  ✓ Don't claim expertise you don't have
  ✓ Say "Learning" for skills under development
  ✓ Be specific about what you can do
  ✓ Recruiters appreciate honesty
  ✗ Don't lie about skills - they'll ask you to code during interview
  ✗ Don't include skills you've only watched tutorials for
  ✗ Don't claim advanced skills if you're still learning

SKILL PROGRESSION GUIDE:
  Level 1 - Beginner:
    "I completed tutorials in [skill]"
    Example: "Started learning React through freeCodeCamp"
  
  Level 2 - Learning/Practicing:
    "I've built projects with [skill]"
    Example: "Built 3 projects using React and hooks"
  
  Level 3 - Intermediate:
    "I'm comfortable with [skill] and use it regularly"
    Example: "Comfortable building React components and managing state"
  
  Level 4 - Advanced/Expert:
    "I've built complex projects and understand advanced concepts"
    Example: "Proficient with React optimization, custom hooks, and best practices"

SKILL CATEGORIES:

FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES:
  - HTML5 - Semantic markup, accessibility, proper structure
  - CSS3 - Flexbox, Grid, responsive design, animations
  - JavaScript - ES6+, DOM manipulation, events, async/await
  - React - Functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect), props

BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES:
  - Node.js - Creating servers, handling requests, file operations
  - Express.js - Routing, middleware, request/response handling
  - MongoDB - Database operations, collections, queries

TOOLS & PRACTICES:
  - Git/GitHub - Version control, commits, branches, pull requests
  - VS Code - Debugging, extensions, terminal integration
  - Terminal/CLI - File navigation, npm commands, git commands
  - Problem-solving - Debugging, research, asking for help

WHERE TO ADD SKILLS:
  1. Find the appropriate category (Frontend, Backend, Tools)
  2. Add a new <li> item with your skill
  3. Be specific about what you learned
  4. Update as you learn new skills

WHERE TO REMOVE SKILLS:
  - If you haven't used a skill in a real project, remove it
  - If you're no longer maintaining a skill, remove it
  - Keep only skills you can comfortably explain

EXAMPLE SKILLS LIST (FOR MERN STUDENT):
  Frontend:
    ✓ HTML5 (semantic markup)
    ✓ CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, responsive design)
    ✓ JavaScript (ES6+, DOM manipulation, event handling)
    ✓ React (components, hooks - useState/useEffect, props)
  
  Backend:
    ✓ Node.js (beginner - creating simple servers)
    ✓ Express.js (beginner - building basic APIs)
    ✓ MongoDB (beginner - basic CRUD operations)
  
  Tools:
    ✓ Git & GitHub
    ✓ VS Code
    ✓ Terminal (basic navigation and npm)

TODO: When styling:
  - Group skills by category with color coding
  - Add proficiency level badges (Beginner, Learning, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Create visual skill cards
  - Show skill progress with progress bars
  - Use icons to represent technologies
  - Make skills searchable/filterable

TODO: When learning new skills:
  - Update this section IMMEDIATELY after learning
  - Build a project using the new skill
  - Add it to your portfolio
  - Move from "Learning" to higher levels as you progress
  - Remove skills you're no longer maintaining

SKILL LEVEL INDICATORS (for CSS styling later):
  .skill-beginner { badge or color }
  .skill-learning { badge or color }
  .skill-intermediate { badge or color }
  .skill-advanced { badge or color }

UPDATING YOUR SKILLS SECTION:
  Quarter 1: Focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals
  Quarter 2: Add React basics, start JavaScript projects
  Quarter 3: Add Node.js, Express, MongoDB as you learn
  Quarter 4: Show proficiency in MERN stack

WHAT RECRUITERS LOOK FOR:
  - Continuous learning and skill development
  - Realistic assessment of skill levels
  - Multiple projects demonstrating each skill
  - Evidence of deep understanding (can explain in interview)
  - Growth trajectory over time
