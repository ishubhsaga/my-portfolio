HEADER / HERO SECTION - REFERENCE FILE
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  This file documents the header/hero section content and structure.
  In the main index.html, this content is embedded directly within the <header> tag.
  
NOTE:
  This portfolio uses a single index.html file for simplicity.
  All sections are contained within one file.
  The comments in index.html explain each section thoroughly.

WHAT THE HEADER DOES:
  - Makes a first impression on visitors
  - Introduces you and your professional role
  - Catches visitor attention immediately
  - Clearly mentions your learning focus (MERN Stack)
  - Sets the tone for the entire portfolio

WHERE TO EDIT (in index.html):
  Find the <header id="header"> tag and update:
  - Your name in the <h1> tag
  - Your title/role in the first <p> tag
  - Your introduction/tagline in the second <p> tag

EXAMPLE OF WHAT TO EDIT:
  Current:
    <h1>Hi, I'm John Doe</h1>
  
  Change to:
    <h1>Hi, I'm Your Name</h1>

  Current:
    <p>Student Web Developer | Learning MERN Stack</p>
  
  Change to match your focus. You could write:
    <p>Student Web Developer | Building with React & Node.js</p>
    <p>CS Student | MERN Stack Enthusiast</p>

TODO: When adding CSS:
  - Add background color or gradient
  - Add background image
  - Use large, bold fonts for visual impact
  - Add padding and margin for breathing room
  - Consider adding CSS animations on page load
  - Make text stand out with contrast

TODO: When styling for design:
  - Make it a "hero" section with full-screen height
  - Add visual hierarchy (h1 larger than p tags)
  - Use interesting typography
  - Add call-to-action buttons ("View My Work", "Contact Me")
  - Consider adding a parallax effect

ACCESSIBILITY TIPS:
  - Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 for main title)
  - Ensure text color has good contrast with background
  - Don't rely only on color to convey information
  - Make sure text is readable on all screen sizes
